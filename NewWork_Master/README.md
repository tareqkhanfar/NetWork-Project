# TCP Web Server with Multiple Content Types and Error Handling
This web server is designed to handle requests over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and supports multiple content types, including HTML, CSS, and all image formats. It also includes support for redirecting users to other websites and handling 404 errors.

To use the web server, users must first download and install the server software on their machine. Once installed, they can start the server and configure it to listen for incoming requests on a specific port.

When a user sends a request to the server, the server will parse the request and determine the appropriate response. If the requested resource exists and the server supports the content type, the server will return the resource to the user with the appropriate headers. If the resource does not exist or the server does not support the content type, the server will return a 404 error.

In addition to serving resources, the server also supports redirection. If a user requests a resource that has been moved to a new location, the server can redirect the user to the new location using a 301 or 302 status code.

One of the key advantages of this web server is its support for multiple content types, which allows users to serve a wide range of resources to their audience. Additionally, the server's error handling capabilities ensure that users receive appropriate feedback when a resource cannot be found or is otherwise unavailable.

Overall, this web server can be a powerful tool for serving content to users over the TCP protocol. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, this server provides the flexibility and functionality you need to deliver high-quality content to your audience.
